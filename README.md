# Connect to Operator using Event Sink & External Policy Server for Pexip Infinity

This function connects a caller with the best available operator in Pexip Infinity deployments.  This function is deployed as a function app in Azure, and configured as an event sink in Pexip Infinity.

The function stores all events from the event sink in one database, and stores currently active participants in another database.  When a caller (in this case an EMT) calls into connect to the operator, the function looks for operators among the currently active participants and then dials from the EMT's conference to the operator's conference via the Pexip Infinity management API.

The EventSink function listens for all events coming from Pexip.  It then sends messages along to message queues to be handled.  The QueueAllEvents function puts all events into the 'events' database, with unique IDs generated by Cosmos and `event_type` as partition key.  The QueueParticipantEvents function is only called for `participant_connected` and `participant_disconnected` events, and adds or deletes participants into the 'ActiveCalls' database, with the Call_ID as the unique ID and `service_tag` as the partition key.  This means that the 'ActiveCalls' database maintains a list of currently connected callers.
